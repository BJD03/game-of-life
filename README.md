# Conway's Game of Life (C++)

A terminal-based implementation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton that simulates how simple rules can produce complex, emergent patterns.

## Features
- Runs entirely in the command line/terminal
- Configurable grid size and randomized starting patterns
- Automatic generation updates with adjustable speed

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C++17 or later**
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`)

## Notes
- Currently, there is no way to begin with customized patterns, as the grid fills randomly on each run and gernally devolves into random noise
- In order to stop the program, the terminal must be closed
